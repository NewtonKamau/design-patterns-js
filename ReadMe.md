## Introduction

Design patterns are essential tools in a developer's toolkit. They help in solving common software design challenges, providing a consistent and efficient approach to various problems.

This repository aims to provide clear explanations and practical code examples for each design pattern. Each pattern is implemented in JavaScript to illustrate its usage in real-world scenarios. The examples demonstrate how to separate concerns and achieve loose coupling between components, enabling developers to create robust and maintainable applications.

## Patterns

### Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is commonly used when you need a single shared resource throughout the application.

### Factory Pattern

The Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes. It encapsulates object creation logic, promoting loose coupling and flexibility.

### Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects, allowing them to automatically notify and update their dependent objects. It promotes loose coupling between components.

### Mediator Pattern

The Mediator pattern centralizes communication between objects by introducing a mediator object. It helps in reducing dependencies and simplifying the interaction between components.

### Chain of Responsibility Pattern

The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until it is handled or reaches the end of the chain. It promotes decoupling and flexibility in handling requests.

### Visitor Pattern

The Visitor pattern allows adding new operations to a set of classes without modifying their structure. It separates the algorithm from the objects it operates on, enabling extensibility and cleaner code.

### Strategy Pattern

The Strategy pattern defines a family of interchangeable algorithms and encapsulates each one as a separate class. It allows clients to switch algorithms at runtime without altering their code.

### Template Method Pattern

The Template Method pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations for certain steps. It promotes code reuse and flexibility in algorithm design.

### Command Pattern

The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

### Iterator Pattern

The Iterator pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. It encapsulates the traversal logic within an iterator object.

## Usage

You can explore each design pattern by navigating to the respective folders in this repository. Each folder contains an explanation of the pattern and a practical example implemented in JavaScript.

To run the examples, you can simply clone the repository and execute the JavaScript files using Node.js:

```
git clone https://github.com/NewtonKamau/design-patterns-js.git

cd design-patterns-js/patternName
node index.js
```
